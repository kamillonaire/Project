# CODE Lancashire Project
i am developing a website for an hospital that will have the basic feature of CSS, HTML and Javascript
the link provided in the html section is that of CODE Lancashire, as i am still developing my skills in both front-end and back-end development
it is still a work in progress as i look forward to add more javascript features to the project
